WEATHER BASED OUTFIT RECOMMENDER
I created this web page to allow users to search for any location and view its current temperature while also receiving outfit suggestions along with corresponding outfit images.
The weather data is fetched from OpenWeather, and I built the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To enhance efficiency, I utilized resources like Google, ChatGPT, and YouTube during development.
The project consists of three main files: index.html, styles.css, and scripts.js. Initially, I stored outfit images in a local folder, but since this caused loading delays, I optimized the implementation to use image URLs instead.
Additionally, the web page dynamically changes its background color to a light temperature-based shade, enhancing the user experience.The temperature search segment is divided into four segments:
1.below 10 degree celsius
2.between 10 to 20 degree celsius
3.between 20 to 30 degree celsius
4.above 30 degree celsius
Using the web page is simpleâ€”copy all the three files to your computer and then open the index.html file in a browser like Chrome or Bing, enter a location (e.g., Mangalore or London), and the page will display the temperature along with suitable outfit recommendations and images.
Future enhancements for the project may include improved UI/UX with better styling and animations, expanded outfit recommendations considering additional factors like humidity and wind speed.
